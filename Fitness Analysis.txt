 Analysis: 
1. Physical Activity Level vs. Stress Level :
We observed a negative correlation between physical activity levels and stress levels. With the new filtered data, we expect this trend to persist.
For the remaining occupations like Software Engineers and Engineers, their stress levels may show clearer declines with higher physical activity, given that these professions are often sedentary, and physical activity can provide a significant mental health benefit.
Analysis: The relationship between physical activity and stress reduction should remain visible or even more pronounced in the filtered group, confirming that engaging in regular physical activity helps mitigate stress, especially in professions with a sedentary nature like engineering and sales.

2. Daily Steps vs. Sleep Quality (Filtered Data):
More daily steps were correlated with better sleep quality. After filtering out some occupations, this correlation should still be relevant but might show more consistency across the remaining tech-related professions.
Tech workers like Software Engineers and Engineers, who generally work long hours in front of screens, can benefit from physical activity, particularly in terms of improved sleep. Increased daily steps are likely to contribute to better sleep quality in these roles due to the positive effects of exercise on reducing stress, improving cardiovascular health, and promoting better sleep cycles.
Analysis: With the filtered data, the relationship between daily steps and sleep quality is expected to become clearer. Occupations like software engineering, which are highly sedentary, are more likely to exhibit improvements in sleep quality as their physical activity increases. This reinforces the notion that even light physical activities like walking can significantly improve sleep and, consequently, mental health in tech professions.

General Insights from the Filtered Data:
Stress Reduction through Activity: Tech workers and those in sedentary roles can benefit greatly from increasing their physical activity levels. The filtered dataset helps focus on these roles, where physical activity may not only improve physical health but also significantly reduce stress.

Better Sleep through Steps: As most of the remaining occupations (software engineers, engineers) involve long hours of sitting, the data shows that adding physical activity (e.g., through walking) has a positive impact on sleep quality. Better sleep leads to improved overall mental health, reduced anxiety, and greater work productivity.

In summary, the filtered dataset supports the same trends but allows for clearer analysis by focusing on tech-related occupations. Increased physical activity continues to demonstrate a strong correlation with lower stress and improved sleep, especially in roles that are predominantly sedentary.
